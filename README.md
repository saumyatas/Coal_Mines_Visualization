# Coal Mines Visualization
A visualization tool created on Google Earth engine (GEE) to help analyze the coal mining area and predict the period of mining operation.


## Installing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saumyatas/Coal_Mines_Visualization.git
```

## Visulization Plots
With the help of the surrounding areas of the mining area a NDVI reference graph is created to distinguish forest and water bodies from the mining area.

### NDVI reference chart
![NDVI reference chart](Plots/NDVI_ref.png)

With the help of change in NDVI we can predict that the period of operation for this mine started in early 2016 or late 2015.

### NDVI of the mining area

## Visulization GIFs

The expansion of mining area and change in operation can be visualized using Landsat series satellite data.
